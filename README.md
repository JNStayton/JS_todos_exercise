Springboard todo app exercise

A program that generates a list of stuff to do based on your input.
Click on the items in your list to cross them off (i.e. mark as "done"), but keep them on the list.
Click on the X button to delete the item from the list permanently.
The list should stay on the page if you refresh the page.
